昨天在英语课上成功地糟蹋了这首经典歌曲，愧疚中，把歌词先挂在这里，以后再练练



<strong>Yesterday</strong>
<em>the beatles 1962-1966 </em>
the beatles


yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
now it looks as though they're here to stay
oh, i believe in yesterday.
suddenly, i'm not half the man i used to be,
there's a shadow hanging over me.
oh, yesterday came suddenly.
why she had to go i don't know she wouldn't say.
i said something wrong, now i long for yesterday.
yesterday, love was such an easy game to play.
now i need a place to hide away.
oh, i believe in yesterday.
why she had to go i don't know she wouldn't say.
i said something wrong, now i long for yesterday.
yesterday, love was such an easy game to play.
now i need a place to hide away.
oh, i believe in yesterday.
mm mm mm mm mm
